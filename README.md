# Supply-chain-management-sales-analysis

Supply chain analytics is a valuable part of data-driven decision-making in various industries such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and logistics. It is the process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting data related to the movement of products and services from suppliers to customers.

# Key Insights & Visuals

Inventory: Identified overstocked SKUs and frequent stock-outs; recommended ABC analysis and better demand planning.

Procurement: Vendor X offers best cost-efficiency; lead times vary—need for vendor review.

Logistics: 87% on-time delivery; delays mostly in West and South zones; freight cost optimization needed.

Fulfillment: Reduced order cycle time by 15%; rising backorders signal need for improved forecasting.

Interactivity: Filters and drill-downs enable region-, SKU-, and vendor-specific analysis.

# Project Goal
To provide a dynamic Power BI dashboard that delivers real-time insights into supply chain operations—helping stakeholders reduce costs, improve vendor performance, optimize inventory, and enhance overall efficiency.
